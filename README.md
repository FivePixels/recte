# recte
recte is a jailbreak tweak that removes the Accessory view from the Pandora app when a device connects to a stereo with Pandora built in. I wrote this tweak because when I connect my phone to my car stereo, it doesn't allow me to use the app. This fixes that annoyance.

## Compiling
To compile, you should comment the current include lines and uncomment the ones commented above it. Then run:
```
make package
```
to compile the package. Move the `.deb` file to your iOS device.
